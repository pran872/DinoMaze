An augmented reality-based educational app for students with neurodegenerative diseases like cerebral palsy. As a part of our third-year software engineering project for the Programming 3 module of Imperial College London's Bioengineering course, we partnered with the Pace Centre UK to deliver a usable product for 5 to 12-year-old kids with any CP level. This is also a supervisor-friendly platform. The instructor, the physiotherapist or the psychologists, all types of supervisors can create a teacher profile that has access to added features to help the kids.
